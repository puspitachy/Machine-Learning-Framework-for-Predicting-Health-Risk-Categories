# Machine-Learning-Framework-for-Predicting-Health-Risk-Categories
The proposed research study will develop a comprehensive end-to-end Ma- chine Learning (ML) system to mitigate analytical challenges posed by BRFSS data and ensure the overall rigor and repro- ducibility of the ML-based approach.


# 🩺 Health Risk Research & Analysis (BRFSS Dataset)

A research-driven project analyzing population-level health patterns using the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset.  
This project focuses on **research, analysis, writing, and interpretation** of health-related behavioral data to understand which individuals fall into high-risk vs. low-risk categories.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project explores:
- Key demographic and lifestyle factors affecting health status  
- Differences between high-risk and low-risk groups  
- Data patterns that support public health insights  
- Structured reporting and long-form analysis  

The goal is to convert raw survey data into **clear, meaningful health insights**.
